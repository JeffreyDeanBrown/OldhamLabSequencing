# OldhamLabSequencing

This GitHub is primarily to document the scripts I have used for this project. I hope future students will find it helpful, but it is by no means written
with the intention of being easy to understand. Anyone who is also working on this project should find this helpful, but you will need to read through
the scripts and make sure you understand what it's doing.

**run_all**: This takes a directory full of forward and reverse reads, sorts them into individual folders (one per sample), and runs the assembly/annotation pipeline for each folder

**cat_samples**: This is a simple script used to concatenate the L001 and L002 samples of each isolate type

The scripts should be somewhat annotated, so read through the comments within the scripts for help.

## Note:

Most of the notes on this project (and an overview of software used) is currently in the project's Microsoft OneDrive Folder. I will sort out a way to organize & integrate
these two things (the OneDrive and this Github) at a future date.
