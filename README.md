# OldhamLabSequencing

This GitHub is primarily to document the scripts I have used for this project. I hope future students will find it helpful, but it is by no means written
with the intention of being easy to understand. Anyone who is also working on this project should find this helpful, but you will need to read through
the scripts and make sure you understand what it's doing.

The scripts should be somewhat annotated, so read through the comments within the scripts for help.
